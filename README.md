# ESP32 IoT Ontology (Protégé / OWL)

This repository contains an OWL ontology built in Protégé to model an ESP32-based environmental monitoring system, including devices, sensors, telemetry readings, cloud services, dashboards, and alerts.

## What’s included
- Protégé ontology file (.owl)
- Screenshots of classes, properties, and visualization
- Project report/documentation
- Dataset used for examples/testing

## Folder structure
- `/dataset` → dataset files used in the project
- `/images` → screenshots (Protégé, visualizations, reasoner, etc.)
- `/ontology` → OWL file + ontology notes
- `/report` → report and write-ups


## Tools used
- Protégé (OWL ontology modeling)
- OntoGraf / visualization screenshots

## Notes
This project focuses on structuring IoT system knowledge (ESP32 + sensors + cloud data logging) in a clear and reusable semantic model.
