# Ontology (OWL / Protégé)

This folder contains the main OWL ontology file created in Protégé.

The ontology models an ESP32 IoT monitoring system by defining key classes (device, sensors, measurements, cloud services, dashboards, alerts) and the relationships and data properties that connect them.
